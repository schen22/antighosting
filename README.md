Made more as a gag app, audience size = 1 (myself)

* Purpose: to prompt me when I send audio messages to my friends
* Problem to solve: I wanna make sure I check in with my friends in a higher-value way than just random texts, and helping me remember to stay in touch (+how). Kinda.

Used chatgpt to code this up with prompts powered by OpenAI.
